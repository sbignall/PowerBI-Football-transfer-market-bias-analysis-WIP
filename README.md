# PowerBI-Football-Transfer-Market-Bias-Analysis-
A trend report and predictive analysis conducted via PowerBI of the purported 'English Bias' in the English football transfer market



DESCRIPTION



In the English football transfer market, the transfer values of English players between Premier League football clubs are believed by many to be disproportionately high relative to their foreign counterparts considering the ability or game-to-game output of the players in question. In this project, I built a number of models and visualizations in PowerBI to compare the price, estimated market value and performance of English and foreign players. This was done in several steps:




METHOD


A variety of steps were necessary for this project:


1. Gather statistical performance and transfer value data for a number of English players sold to English clubs across the last x years 




3. Perform a number of analyses to determine which factors appear to affect transfer values the most, and determine if this is different for foreign vs English players




5. Use these data to train a model to predict transfer values of foreign players, and a separate model for English players




7. Run English and Foreign players on their counterpart models and compare the actual transfer values vs the predicted values




9. Design dashboards for each player detailing their statistics and expected (via models) vs actual market value




11. Design dashboards detailing overall differences between English and Foreign players and the factors involved
